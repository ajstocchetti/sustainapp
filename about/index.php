	<p>In a world with an ever growing number of products available, there comes a point where more for less is no longer better. Instead of wanting more shirts, or cheaper shirts, maybe you just want a good shirt. <i>Crazy, we know.</i> Well with all the advertising misdirection and greenwashing (when a company spends more time and money telling you how environmentally friendly they are than actually implementing practices that make it a more sustainable business) out there, that can sometimes be harder than it sounds. To feel confident that you are supporting the best company in a given industry, you need to know how they are rated. The system we use does just that.</p>
	<p>SustainApp is committed to providing <a href="#CSR">Social Responsibility</a> ratings for companies; with the belief that educated consumers will purchase from companies that have more equitable business practices. If enough of us start voting with our dollars and support companies that do not exploit humans and resources as though they are just a means to profit, then maybe together we can lift people out of poverty, create a cleaner environment, and buy the best shirt.</p>

		<h4>Social Responsibility</h4>
		<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the impact a business has on its surroundings, including both environmental factors and human relations. Factors such as waste and pollution, testing on animals, fair pay and livable wages, giving back through donations and volunteering all attribute to a company’s CSR. Social responsibility is the impact that people make on their surroundings. The CSR of the companies you support (through promotion, discussion, and purchasing their goods and services) has a direct impact on an individual's social responsibility.</p>

		<h4>Our Rankings</h4>
		<p>SustainApp’s database of CSR rankings is not the only CSR database. It is unique, however, in the quality and accuracy of data. Most other CSR collections have biased data. Often, the company under review is funding the audit, so the auditors feel pressure to present a positive CSR, skewing the data.</p>
		<p>Our CSR rankings was developed by Dr. Ellis Jones, an expert in the field of Social Responsibility. He has compiled data from various NGO and non-profits performing independent studies in their area of expertise, thus creating an unbised dataset of thousands of companies. The scores for this app consider Human Rights, Environmental Impact, Animal Protection, Community Involvement, and Social Justice. CSR rating provided by Better World Shopper.
